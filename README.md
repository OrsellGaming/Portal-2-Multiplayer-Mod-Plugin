# Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod Plugin

## **Created by Nanoman2525 & NULLderef. Maintained by Orsell.**

The Portal 2 Source Engine server plugin used to run the 2.2.x+ versions of the Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod.

**This plugin currently only works for Windows. Only designed to work with Portal 2. Portal 2 based mods may work but haven't been tested.**

This plugin has been put into a separate repository due to the nature of the development and compiling environment of Source Engine plugins. The plugin alone can not make the Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod work. If you are looking to play the Portal 2: Multiplayer Mod itself, please look at this repository instead: <https://github.com/Portal-2-Multiplayer-Mod/Portal-2-Multiplayer-Mod>

The purpose of this plugin is to patch Portal 2 to make the mod work as well as fix some bugs that impact multiplayer sessions. The plugin also provides access to features of the Source Engine directly that can be interfaced with by VScript.

## VScript Functions Added To Interface With The Engine:

const char* GetPlayerName(int index)                 | "Gets player username by index."
